  Though it is android TV comes with pre-installed PRIME VIDEO and other Video apps, Prime video and other apps are getting crashed.  i have raised complaint to Amazon to troubleshoot the issue and their technician has reported that TV has issues without showing-up to my house . i've also contacted VU customer service, they said this model has issue. i really had bad experience with amazon service. the lesson i learnt is buy it from your local shops around you, instead of going through this hardship. Zero Star for their valuable service. i don't thing Amazon will post my review.

  So, bought this TV during the recent Great Indian sale.1) This TV is apt for viewing distance of 10-15 feet - Comes with the wall mount.2) The picture quality and sound is actually good - Not attaching images as I am not good with photography.3) Pre-installed apps are working fine (Netflix/Zee5/Hotstar/the usual runners).4) Play store provides ample other options.What's not working:1) So, this probably is a Amazon Prime issue. I am not sure (need to call Amazon) but my Prime is not working. Like the device is registering to my account however when I try to play the video - I get a msg to go to amazon.com/videohelp. Which really is not helping. I can cast via my phone though so I guess, it's not a complete dead end.2) Phone mirroring works however lags by a few seconds.Overall, a must buy at the discounted price that I bought it - INR 18k.Final word, a big thank you to the installation team. Missed the first schedule (understandable during sale season) however, second run wasn't a Miss and the guy was good. No hassle and polite.

  True Android TV running smoothly on Android 9.0.Pros -Total value for money, way ahead of Mi Tv or any other low budget buy in this price rangeAndroid 9.0 and all featured apps working like a charmDecent looks and premium remoteCons-Sound quality, picture clarity is slightly under par when compared to LGs, Sony, and Samsungs but hey you are paying way less for it.**Prime Videos were not working initially but after an OS update and restart, it is working seamlessly.

  Honest Review.*Price- I got this with exchange and card discounts at 12k.. Without exchange u can het this around 17k.*Display - I am a marvel fan, i like to watch super heroes movies and this TV is a treat. Good clarity, color reproduction. No complaints from my end on this.. Yes i have observed that when we see from side closely we see little negative images maybe because of big screen to believe me this won't be a problem as i never had.. We see movies from from not from completely edge side of tv right..*Sound - Sound is decent don't expect to work like soundbar.. I had LG tv earlier and comparing that with this sound is 40% better louder and clear.. But if u wish to have home theatre experience get home theater..*Processor- To be honest i dont have any technical info on this but yes i download 1080p HD BluRay Movies in HEVC (Highly compress) format. My LG TV never read this format but this TV play smoothly without any glitches..  I have also downloaded MX player (as this is android tv).*Casting- Yes this is where i removed one star.. Casting need Internet connection unlike other Mi smart tv which works directly without Internet. Was very difficult for me to cast mobile to TV, at the end i used my mobile hot-spot to do so. This can be resolved with firestick (i had this earliesr to make my normal LG TV smart) or any other smart casting device which normally cost 1k. If anyone knows how to cast offline in this TV pls let me know.*Connectivity - No problem here.. It has Bluetooth, wifi, 3.5 jack, HDMI Arc.... Refer my screenshot..Conclusion : With this said i am happy with my android TV.. I get real Theater experience with big screen watching HD movies..You would get many reviews here but believe me there is nothing in this TV which may make u regret buying it..

  Plain cheating by Vu - this TV does not support Prime Video and Netflix, although the apps come pre-loaded and the remote comes with dedicated buttons. Secondly, it's got an extremely slow processor. Even YouTube takes a lot of time to load. Lastly, it was a nightmare to return this TV. I must have spent several hours over one week with Amazon customer care, to finally get the return approved.Both Prime Video Customer Care as well as the Vu company's technicians told me that this TV wouldn't run Prime Video and Netflix. It's shocking that Vu is so blatantly misleading their online customers; equally shocking is the fact that Amazon is also not doing anything about it.

  Amazing Build Quality ,picture and sound and software is a little bit messy at first because Amazon Prime will not work ,so what i did was contacted VU Technical Support and they have released an update of 852 mb.Now you should install that update and once again check Amazon Prime,if the problem persists you should factory reset your smart TV.This will automatically updates the old version to new version and Amazon prime will work Flawlessly.Google chromecast works fine nothing to worry about.casted a Amazon prime video (when inbuilt app was not working ) for about 3 hours without issueNeed to check Netflix and Kodi and keep you posted.

  Avoid buying from amazonVu 43"" ultra android tv is a good buy at 21k and value for money, the picture quality and sound quality are good at this price. Also it comes with stock Android 9. The only issue which I have faced is prime video not working properly (which resolved through an update by proactive support from vu customer care) though has separate option in remote and mentioned in offering. It also sometimes responds a bit slow to remote actions.Unless you are ok with spending hours explaining issues to Amazon customer care executives one after another don't buy it from amazon, supposedly there is a large appliance customer care team which, as per my experience, is pathetic. Sharing the issues I have faced so that you are well aware of challenges when you buy any large appliance from Amazon:Installation: The installation guy has not come at the scheduled slot with no information. I was supposed to keep waiting for him. Once the waiting time (1.5 hours) is over I had to spend 3 hours explaining the issue to Amazon customer care, with no resolution. Supposedly there are different teams and call will get transferred to different executives and keep waiting on music (you would be asked to receive a call back from chat executive) and explaining the issue again and again. Finally, they told me they are unable to help. Installation guy came to my place 10 days after the tv delivery.Warranty: Though there was free extended warranty from acko as per the offer when I bought the tv. I have not recieved any information regarding the same. I had  contacted Amazon customer care regarding the same and again faced the same pattern. After spending one hour ten mins explaining the issue to different executives I was asked to call again after few hours. Knowing the final response and the hastle I have to go though with Amazon large appliance customer care, I have decided to forget about the extended warranty. I believe a good number of frustrated customers may not follow up for warranty.

  Ultra Android VU TV newly lauched is ultra bad. Remote has dedicated prime button but prime not supported. Google assistant app present in the TV...no voice support on remote. Service engineer has no knowledge. Unable to explain any features. TVS e service providers should train n update the engineers. 24*7 Amazon prime customer service is unable to resolve the issues. Overall don't buy. Atrocious buy.

  Well for starters the complete playstore is not available. I could not even find Google Chrome but yes the picture quality is excellent and the sound too has become quite good since my first Vu TV. Overall a very good buy. So what exactly did I do for it to work. Firstly stop all updates. Not even system update cause the screen just stays put and nothing gets installed. Next step was to start installing desirable apps & to me the first I needed was a file explorer & a browser I found in playstore by searching just those words. Once that was done I did a system update. Now I can run any App bit Prime Video.When I try to log in it says can't login register on Prime ideo/MyTV. When I give the hashkey provided it says registration successful but on seeing devices registered this TV won't be found. So basically a dead end. Casting is slow but you need to only cast prime video else everything else can be side loaded. That is search for the app on your phone and install it via USB using file explorer.Yes Thope TV, Oreo TV, Typhoon TV, etc will work seamlessly. So basically it is not so simple but once you do everything falls in place. Would I recommend it? Damn well I will for at this price you get an excellent screen, sound again is very good & almost any Android App can be installed. No not Jio TV. I can see only half the screen!Update...Well when folks from VuTv called for feedback I did tell them about the Amazon Prime issue. The caller noted it down and sent me a PDF file containing the solution. It was upgrading OS to a Sep release & doing a reset. Now I had installed Apps & was wary of doing a reset. Now they called again to check if I had done the update or needed help. I said I hadn't done but they said everything would be fine. So I did a reset and was able to login to Amazon Prime & it worked. Also the sluggishness of casting got solved.  So I am upgrading the rating to 5 stars from 4...

  Picture quality and sound quality is very good in this price range.

So no problem with VU. Excellent service.I will add more detailed review after using TV for 2 months.But Amazon and VECare need to improve their service and professionalism.

   The amazon prime issue is solved by doing a factory reset of the tv. This Tv has decent build quality, picture quality and most of the features you would require factoring in the price you pay.However, what bothers me the most is the poor sound quality. It distorts with a jarring effect whenever there is any sound with bass in it, for example background music, loud noises etc. This happens not only on high volume but on low volume as well as well. The sound comes off as boxy and annoying. Have tried different sound setting as well but can't seem to resolve the issue. Not sure if this problem is being faced by everyone or for my tv alone hence am going to ask for a replacement.Update 1:The Technician that Amazon sent to check the TV has now confirmed that there is a functional problem with the sound of the TV and it needs to be replaced. However, after many phone calls with Amazon customer care they are now telling me that the option to replace the TV is not appearing in their backend system and there is only an option for initiating a refund.However, a refund is not the solution for me as the price for the same model has now gone up by 1500/- on Amazon (from the same seller, Cloudtail), so I can't repurchase the same model at the price I paid.All this while they were assuring me that the TV would be replaced if a fault was found but are now saying that they can only refund the amount paid as the TV is not in stock with the vendor. This is not true as it is still available on the Amazon site through the same vendor albeit at a higher price i.e. 19999/- (instead of 18499/-, which is the amount I paid for it).Since all of this is no fault of mine I do hope they are able to resolve this issue amicably without further delayUpdate 2:Finally received a replacement for the TV a few days back. But was suspicious as it did not come in the type of packaging as the first TV I received (no protective plastic covering on the outside of the box).  Once the technician opened the box to install the same we found out it was a used TV as there was no protective plastic covering the TV inside the box as well, the TV was just placed inside the box with the accessories. The remote batteries were already inside the remote and once the TV was switched on it went directly to the viewing screen without going through any setup.Add to all this the sound issue persisted in this TV as well so had no option but to return the same for a refund.Please be aware that Amazon is recirculating these TVs and hence their customers must make sure that they are infact receiving a new/unused piece.This has been one of the few times I've had a bad experience with Amazon but hopefully they look into the matter.

  1) Color and brightness, overall display is very good2) Wifi connectivity is excellent3) If you want to enable 1080p display, you need to turn on both ""Game Mode & PC Mode"" in advanced video option.4) Sound quality is very good when you turn on ""DTS-StudioSound"" in sound option.5) Amazon Prime, Hotstar and Netflix can watch without any issues after update of Android. But the wifi net should be high-speed to enjoy the High quality streaming.Overall a very best TV in this price.I give 4.5 star out of 5.

  Amazon and installation team did a good job in delivering(10th) and installing the TV as per schedule on 11-10-2019.Thanks.Coming to  performance of the tv, it coonected well with WiFi. Not yet tried other smart TV featuresThe picture quality is not good for a FHD TV.  Color reproduction is not good with pink skin tone, smudged picture, no sharp pictures. Quite surprised to note that It is like a early vintage CRT TV. Not able to identify distant objects in the screen.Sound is good with stereo and surround sound working well. But, loud annoying sound alerts while scrolling down any menu items in picture modes, sound styles and other settings is a cause of concern. It's only one day after delivery. Watch for 2/3 days and if the performance of the tv doesn't improve, think of returning for exchange.Now after checking it's is found that it's resolution is not 1920X1080. It's only 1280X720p. Not Full HD. Any takers.

  Bought a 43 inch variant as I needed a secondary tv. It's been a week now and I'm totally satisfied with the purchase. Was a bit disappointed when amazon prime refused to sign me in even after multiple attempts. Did some research and reset the tv from home screen - settings and wolla! Prime works like a charm now. Good buy for the price point. Extended warranty of 2 yrs is available through vu for a very reasonable price!

  PROS:Picture Quality: Upscaling technology of of this TV is good. SD channels were quite decent. HD channels were great. Picture reproduction is a bit weird in few cases. Yellow appears orange. Picture quality is sharp and clear. You just need the setting correct. Enabled the PC/Game mode and motion blurred can be reduced to a great extent.Sound: Stereo sound is Loud and clear. However, beyond 25% volume, the sound cracks and not audible. Note, get your sound settings correct. You have a option to choose between 'stereo' sound and 'surround' sound. 'Stereo' is good for music whereas 'surround' is good for dialogues (movies/serials).Screen Cast: No lags. You will need to download 'Google Home' app. Offline content cannot be casted without a internet/Wifi though.Viewing angles: I viewed upto 45 degree angles, and it didnt disturb the picture qualityYoutube: Played excellently well. No lags at all. Music played in stereo sound setting were treat to my ears. The Bass effects are awesome.Boot time: TV restarts just under 15 secondsOTT apps: Works fine. No issuesCONS:Remote: No Bluetooth in remote, so you typing/searching is a pain. Downloading android TV remote app can partially take care of typing. You will need to carry 3 remotes (TV remote, DTH remote and Mobile remote app)Ultra HD: This is a Full HD TV (1k resolution), not Ultra HD (4k resolution). So if you are going to view this TV majorly for DTH channels and little bit of online contents, Full HD is sufficient.Overall, this is a decent Android TV, but sound cracks beyond 25% .

  I'll address the Amazon PrimeVideo problem first and it's solution. Initially the registration of device was not happening it's a software issue.Solution: Update the TV software. Settings-Device Preferences-About-System update. After its done prime video will work for most but I had trouble even after update. Then I did a reset (last option in Device Preferences) and it solved my issue. Hope this will help others. Picture, Audio and overall performance is great and great value for money.

  For all those whose in built Ch'cast isn't working just change country from USA to India.About the tv. At third of a price compared to known brands with similar features, you simply get what you pay for.Absence of a voice remote irks but considering the performance of the Google app you might as well not have it.Picture is blindingly super bright. I have no idea why the emphasis on bright by all brands. You aren't going to use this in sunlight ... DuhOn the brighter side (no pun there lol) the colours produced are very accurate.A piece of advice. Don't judge it by the dth performance. Judge it by playing some good online content. Colours are generally warm and well, getting adjusted from a pana tv the motion seems jerky to me.Sound is loud enough but at times the speakers can't handle the bass and distortion is more than evident.OS is stock android. And well, stock Android always works best, in my opinion that is.Looks... Really nice. It looks really nice, for the price , yes pretty much.Quality... For starters have a look at the picture shared there is something actually sticking out on the left bottom part of the screen ROFL.

Constant system sound i.e. sound from the left right up down plus clicks is too annoying and there is no way it can be stopped.2. Picture mode and sound mode buttons on remote so not work in tv mode.3. TV remote response is slow and lags. Booting takes significant time as wellComplaint raised but no updates so far. They accepted that these are the issues but that's how it is and no way out.4. Cant return so you have to bear the 20k spent.5. Picture quality is good.6. Sound is loud but not clear and we end up putting it on very high volume.7. Not user-friendly and not many apps on the Play Store. Not sure why they named it ultra android when there is nothing special about this android tv.6. Colours fade when viewed from sides.I will update with other issues if found. Believe me I don't see any features in this tv apart from dedicated buttons on remote for few apps which will be useless if you have hdmi streaming and you can use voice search on jio, firestick etc

  I got this TV in mid month of July and on very second day I reported that the speaker sound is very noisy n breaking.They said someone will visit for inspection but no one came here until 29th n kept rescheduling appointment without my consent.Later inspection happened n guy went without informing the further procedure.Called amazon 4 times they everytime asked for several details n put me on hold and then they disconnect.Worst experience.. Don't buy from Amazon and don't buy VU

  Nice TV with Android 9 out of the box.Netflix,Hot star & YouTube are working fine, however struggling with Amazon prime... Able To cast however the inbuilt app doesn't work. Awesome Display with good brightness and clarity. Placed as second TV in bedroom and it has very nice stereo speakers with awesome sound and watching movies was fun with clear dialogues. First VU TV and its very impressive. As Usual amazon is the best when it comes to delivery and products.Box contains wall mount as well as stand. The Display panel is what impress me the most. The panel used is definately of high grade with awesome clarity.Let's see how VU perform in long run.

  Firstly the installation team sucks. No one came for installation until 4 days after the delivery. I would give zero stars for installation.The product is amazing, it's pure androidTV and like everyone else,i too got trouble with Amazon prime video. I just called VU support and their executive came to my home and upated the tv software. Now prime video is working perfectly fine.Inbuilt Chromecast, Bluetooth and all other features are working well.Overall a good value for money.

  Gorgeous display, and sound quality is amazing too, but a proper soundbar or speakers should be purchased with this.initially was somewhat let down with the picture quality but putting some time in the settings menu and tweaking in the picture settings, the picture quality now looks absolute amazing, have completely cut off the cable and use streaming services to watch content here. installed many streaming apps like zee5 netflix amazon prime eros now, loving it.brought 43 inch and 32 inch for  my bedroom and office. best purchase decision.Did not had any problem while setting up Amazon Prime whatsoever.my advice go for it, play with picture quality settings a bit to get your desired results. and yes, if you plan to use the smart features of tv then get a proper broadband connection, initial setup takes time and there would a very important day one OTA update. make sure you have proper internet, otherwise experience could frustrating with the slower internet speeds.

  This TV was delivered to me on 6th & on 9th Oct the installation was done. All good so far. Happy with the sound & picture quality. Most of the Apps are working fine including Netflix. However I have problems connecting to Amazon Prime. Tried several times, entered the Code from the TV to my Amazon login on my computer. I get a success message on the computer but nothing happens on the TV. Tried calling the Amazon toll free no. but no person to speak with. If someone can help me with this would be highly appreciated.Sorry for the late update. Finally a service guy came to check my TV. Sat from 10:30 until 13:30. Tried several things including some downloads and restarts with no positive result. Promised to get back to me in 2 days. I did not hear from him for 4 days. Then I got a call from Mumbai VU who asked me to do certain updates on the TV. I asked him to call back the next day as I would be near the TV. He did call the next day and finally Amazon Prime started working on 6th Nov. (27 days after the TV was delivered). But I was happy. Then 2 days later the technician who came to my office called to say hes coming to fix the problem. I told him it was already sorted. All is well so far with the TV and its a good buy for the price. Cheers.

  LCD is getting cheaper day by day and I thought i was about to have yet another LCD tv but this surprised me quite a lot. I also own the sony edge lit KDL-55HX800 as well as shinco 49 inch backlit LCD 4k TV.Pros :* Blacks are deep and its good.* I was expecting bleeding around the edges but it was on par with sony in terms of it and there was zero bleeding around the edges.* Smart TV features works good as advertised* NETFLIX, PRIME tv works* Sound is decent although im using a hometheatre* Weightless remote control and convenient button placementsCons :* Initial setup with phone was poor ( if we select 5ghz wifi to connect to, then it will simply freeze. Although i blame google for it)* Sound adjustment can be better. Certain external speakers dont provide bass adjustment and it would be nice if i can adjust bass through the UI.* Its been months since 10 was released and im pretty sure it supports treble. So why the delay the update ( Although this seems to be an issue with most OEMs)

  (2days usage)TV as such has everything working out of the box. Android smart it is ! with good audio (not excellent) and video quality .All streaming services app,playstore etc work as expected once you connect to internet and logins provided . Can't side load apps (i didn't find options yet ) . At this price range what you expect ;).*The biggest spoiler for VU is that Amazon handles the install services very poorly ,it took a week to get this installed (since DIY install void warranty) .At first it was Amazon app giving error to book slots,afterthat It takes 48+hrs fot site visit.*

  Primevideo app started working only after a software upgrade by VU engineer. Netflix, youtube and hotstar are ok. Zee5 was also not working even after upgrade. After a day, update from google play store made the app work. Kodi also pre installed is still not working. Sunnxt installed from google play is ok. Hungama preinstalled is ok.

  Purchased this VU tv after a month of all brands tv reviews consideration in December 2019...Worst part is1. Voice based search option not working2. If you're playing any videos from youtube?/ AP/Netflix after few seconds it stop automatically and display please scan channels..3. Some times no response and needs to restart...I felt happy for 19k but now I am beating with my slipper why did I choose such a worst product even though I know about Android programming and all...

  The product is very good ... delivery was prompt by Amazon as usual !! The picture quality as well as sound quality is pretty good for the price and the Smart TV features work well !! The latest Android pie as the OS delivered a smooth experience, the TV remote is responsive and having direct buttons for Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, Hotstar as well as Google Play helps immensely. Bluetooth connectivity is a boon for connecting wireless headphones etc, Casting your phone works pretty well ... etc. etc. Lot of good features that I found useful. I did compare many similar TV's before buying this one, and am not at all disappointed with my decision till date. I would have loved to have 3 HDMI connections, but that is only a minor miss I would say. This is not my main TV (that is a bigger and high-end TV) so I am not comparing the two, I have a fair understanding and appreciation of AV, hence in my judgement this is a very good TV at this price point (maybe better than some products at a little higher price points than this. I would recommend !!

  I am happy with the Tv. Kindly do not mis-interpretate my review. The Tv takes time to load after starting. Which is completely  fine if I go by the point of view that it is a machine. However being a customer it could be pretty frustrating sometime. Maybe it can be fixed by an update, lets see what happens.As far as the voice recognition is in concern, Remote doesn't work with that, unsure whether that is meant to be in that way or not. Really hope that remote could be used for voice recognition.

   (Jan 5)The a+ grade panel is quite decent. Comparable to an IPS display. Tinker around with the display and sound menu to get the best effect. The blacks when contrasted well look beautiful sometimes. Bezels are decently thin. Do not go with the presets. The processor inside is not the fastest, so expect a lag in navigation (but not in every app). Sound and display adjustments don't work inside the app. Btw, you can use the app, or use the cast feature (they are different features). Using the app usually gives you the highest quality possible. You can set it up in Google Home app as well. I recommend a soundbar with this although the speaker is quite loud. I have dts sound disabled now, will enable when i connect hdmi arc through a soundbar.You can use android remote app from google, works seamlessly. The tv remote is not a motion sensing one.Edit 1 (Jan 10) : Wall mounting done. Professional people. Added video recording of the tv paired to my JBL BAR CINEMA SB110. Took it from all angles possible.Hit the like button if this review was of any help.

  Amazing tv with unsatisfactory sound quality (especially at high level). Quality build. No button to activate google assistant via remote (although tv os has it and can be activated via google's remote app). Also no button to open settings directly via remote when u r watching something and need to change sound or picture quality, very irritating to pause & go back to home screen to access settings everytime. Reducing one star from original because company representative called me to give a good review here to get a 3 month additional warranty. Please VU don't get so low. Negative feedback gives u guys an opportunity to improve.

  This review is edited after about a week of use. Good picture quality, decent sound quality. Best of all, excellent value for money esp with the exchange of my old TV. Earlier, I had Netflix, YouTube working fine but I had mentioned that Amazon Prime I wasn't able to sign in, due to some bug. I got an email from Vu detailing the procedure to ensure that Amazon Prime also works. I had to reset to default settings, but after that Amazon Prime has also started working. So all is fine nowThe delivery was on time, but the installation was delayed by about a week and took several follow ups. But was finally done well.

  1 month review:All good as per the price.Picture quality is good, considering price.Sound is better than okay but not best, considering  price, it is good too.Remote control is not BT but IR, so you need to literally point it at the TV, like it used to be in earlier days.No issues with any app or linking any account on any streaming app as mentioned in other reviews. Thise issues might be there earlier but I haven't faced with any of the apps after 10-06-2020.Apps used - prime videos, netflix, zee5, hotsar, discover+,jioTV, airtelxstream, youtube, facebookwatch, sonyliv, jiocinema, aajtak.1 strange issue, probably not with the TV - prime videos enforce you to use the default profile, you cannot use any other profile.

  The TV is competitively priced with attention to detail in design. An example is during the installation, I noticed that they have taken good care that in a case of wall mount, the mount does not damage the wall & hence some cushion has been provided along.The only which could be improved is the speed. I felt the TV was a bit slower as compared to my other TV although this does not affect the viewing experience & Hotstar takes a long time to load. I am not sure if this is specific to my TV but nothing major as well.Overall a good product in affordable price.I had issues with the installation from Amazon & after escalation, VU themselves made sure the TV is installed on time & checked with me if I am satisfied with the service. That is a really great after sales experience not so common across other brands I use. The person from VU who did the installation was also extremely good & had a good understanding with the installation.The Picture & sound quality is no doubt good for the price.Overall a very pleasant experience so far.

  Purchased this TV recently and feel it was a money well invested.Pros -1. Excellent picture and sound quality. Audio is quite loud.2. Good smart features.3. All necessary apps work well. (A note reg Amazon Prime, once you setup the TV it will update itself. After that do a reset and setup again. The app will work as expected.)4. Great features overall. Bluetooth, Android remote, media player and chromecast work like a charm.5. Sleek and matte black color gives a good look. The bezels are sleek and non reflective.6. All required connectivity options and ports are present.7. Quite lightweight for it's size and company also provides the wall mounts which one has to buy separately otherwise.8. The technician was excellent and completed the installation on time and answered all queries patiently.9. TV is responsive for the most part. Boot time is also good.10. Remote is easy to use and has shortcut buttons for most used contents.Cons -1. Viewing angle could have been better.2. No option to change video/audio settings while watching something. You have to exit the app and do the changes.3. The TV lags a little sometimes but only momentarily.4. No option for voice control in the remote given. The TV supports it and can be used via your mobile phone through android remote app.5. Only concern is the RAM and how it effects the performance of the TV in days to come.

  I was going to buy a premium android tv but then opted for this because it's FHD and not 4k.. Most of the people would go for 4k without knowing that in India TV channels are still being broadcasted at FHD that is if you own FHD channels pack.. Else it's WVGA(480p).. Though VU has a great upscaling quality you will still loose a lot of quality details when upscaling from 480p to 4k.(or even 1080p for that matter in this TV). Netflix has only a few shows in 4K and YouTube has a lot of 4k videos.. Since FHD is still the standard for most things in India..it's preferrable to go for this tv unless you wanna game using PS4 plus or upcoming PS5.. Now coming to the Tv.. it has a great quality 1080p display.. Being smart Android tv.. you can download apps directly from Google Play Store on to your TV..It has around 8gigs internal storage and if you own google nest or mini version you can use it to control your TV too.. Go for it without any thought.. You won't be dissapointed . the only drawback of ghis tv is since it does not have mic you cannot use Google assistant directly to control it but as I said earlier you can use Google nest or mini to control it with voice.. This TV also has an internal Chromecast built in.. (That's why it's smart TV).. You need not buy one.. it's official Google Android smart TV..

  Best tv ever! It's been two weeks since I purchased it. Prime, YouTube, Netflix are pre installed and works great. Initially I couldn't install any app from TV's play store. Thanks to VU Support they advised me to clear the cache memory of Google play, now it's working fine. Watching entire match online through hotstar without any hassle. The picture quality is superb. TV has Bluetooth as well so one can connect Bluetooth headphones as well for sound.

  When I purchased it, I was facing trouble in casting tv with my phone, and zee5 was not working properly, But both problems resolved with first software update. + video quality is good, the sound is loud and clear. UI is good.The problems I can see now is: Half star lost here.1. The missing feature is: no mic/ voice button on remote + voice feature does not work, you can only type key by key using remote which is very hectic thing, when you could just speak and get things types on screen.Below mentioned 2 points are negligible and can be ignored or might be fixed in upcoming releases.2. amazon prime not working, but this is working in the Casting feature.3. sound is a little distorted when we surf/move between apps, only that sound is distorted, tv sound is awesome.Build quality- half star lost here.4. The screen is not 100% fit and taped on corner boundary, I can see light coming out at some places standing parellet to screen, this point I am not considering since we have paid half the price of LG/ Samsung haha.I got this 40-inch device in 18500, 1000 amazon pay cashback I got and 1850 I will get in SBI bank account cashback, So I got it for 15650 :)  + plus point is, got both stands with TV, MItv does not wall mount stand, so save of 400 Rs again. + got Acko 1 year extra warranty from Amazon because of Big festival Sale.Earlier I was confused because of a few above points, but casting resolved half of my doubts :)You can buy it without much doubt.

  Bought this TV 6 days ago.. overall the TV is good but I think there's a problem with Right side speaker of my TV. It makes a buzzing (vibration) sound when audio/video is played, and always while navigating the TV from left to right..while moving left the left speaker sounds perfect but while moving Right the right speaker makes a buzzing sound (I've tried increasing the speaker and muting). Thinking of replacement. Otherwise the overall quality is good.

Composite ports and USB ports responding well but USB 1 is not recognised.Cons1. Disappointing point is the picture quality when vied from an angle.Against claims of 178deg viewing angle, the quality goes on deteriorating as the angle increases and at 178deg it is bad.2.The operating Manual is too concise. Just passing mention about Chromecast, Bluetooth etc and if one is not already some sort of an expert, it will be difficult.Overall Fair quality. Value for money.

  The whole experience with the TV is really good. Amazing picture clarity and sound output is commendable. All the apps works perfectly except Prime Video which is a bummer.

Prashanth from VU called me up and said that the issue should be fixed by updating the software to the latest version. I updated to the latest one (Sept 16th release). It still didn't work.

  It is not a matured android tv.Problems:-1) Unable to do initial configurations with mobile,it simply does not connect to it so need to enter app login credentials through on screen key board which is cumbersome to do with tv remote.2) Every time there is a new firmware update it simply gets reset so now you need to start initial configs again. Do hotstar,amazone prime,google, Zee4 .... and several other app registration again and yeah you need to download them again.3) remote does not have voice recognition.4) Bottom clamp stands are wide and slightly bent outwards so u need a sufficiently bigger table if using table mount.4) When using screen cast it lags in display, so when you swipe to next picture on your phone it will display the next pic on tv screen after about 5 seconds. Forget about HD videos.Okok:-Screen and colour quality is acceptable at this cost.Sound is also normal.

  Brought  Vu premium and Vu UltraAndroid for myself and relatives so here's my short summary.Before getting into the positive  I just want to point out the one con i found so far which is the lack fo 3.o Usb ports for the TV it comes with 2 USB 2.0 ports only.Now, Let's get into the picture quality ,the picture quality is really good with good brightness level and contrast.  FHD channels looks pretty good too.  i don't think you can beat this TV's picture quallity  compared to other TVs on a budget, First thing you notice is how well it upscales Videos that are non FHD to look miles  better. Espcially when there are still alot of Tv channels  in SD,this upscaling feature alone makes the tv worthy along with picture quality.In terms of Android experience it's pretty much Stock android Pie tv experience with occasional  lags here and there even high end Android TV's have this issue so not much to complain here. Tv comes with Netflix Amazon prime youtube and  hotstar installed with first 3apps getting their own  dedicated buttons on the remote .  The picture quality through streaming is pretty good too.Coming to the sound quality i found it  better then my mi soundbar and prefered to use inbuilt tv speaker.It's got good bass ,clarity and quite loud .Conclusion If you are looking mainly for the picture quality on a budget you should be better going of with this or the  non Android VU Ultra Tv for 16k. IF you don't mind spending an extra few thousands you should consider getting the VU premium android 4k not that there are lot of 4k content, but even the FHD channels looks so much better in that tv its more vivid and black levels are deep.  Streamed 4k videos though Youtube to my Vu premium the picture quality is great and got great details to it.For full detailed review i found Techiebeez india channel to have good review of this TV.

  As a TV, it is a good buy. The picture and sound is good. TV design is good but its the software that is a let down. the resolution of home screen etc is a let down. Its not sharp at all. Netflix is working but we are unable to use AMAZON prime ( it is a built in app ). Its much better to buy VU Non Smart tv and purchase a Fire Stick or equi.While that was by earlier review. VU sorted out the problem almost immediately and they definitely deserve a mention and a pat on the back. Seems like my SMART TV is SMART once again. We are more than satisfied with the software now that all our grievance have to looked into.

  I bought this TV last year in Oct 2019 under exchange offer. Working well, picture and sound quality is perfect as per price. Customer care is also quick responsive. I contacted customer care through email and received response within 48 hours (before COVID-19 pandemic). I love their remote that have shortcut buttons for HotStar, Amazon Videos, YouTube, Netflix, it save lot of time and patience while changing the videos.The only issue I am facing is, I can not disable Bluetooth. Customer care recommended to install some app, that I have installed and activated but even after that, I keep getting BLUETOOTH PAIR request from my neighboring devices. Finally we decide to accept the pair if we get any request (not sure what is advantage or disadvantage of doing this).Overall working well and we are fully satisfied.

  I had considered a lot lot of options before I settled down for VU TV. Initially I had a lot of ambiguities as to how VU TV would perform because I had no idea about the TV and its after-sales services. However, today after using the TV for 2 months I am pretty happy and satisfied with my purchase.Pros:a) It has the best display panel and the picture quality is just awesome. Even many of the high end TVs would fall short when compared to this TV with regards to the picture quality.b) many people here have complained that prime video does not work. However be assured that all the smart features off the TV work perfectly fine. Although I would personally recommend to use the TV to view satellite channels and at best USB videos for the best utility.c) Amazon had sent it with utmost care. So kudos to Amazon for perfect packaging and careful delivery.d) VU gives one year warranty on the TV. But an additional 2 years (total 3) can be availed at a very nominal price. It cost me around 1400. So my VU TV is now secured for 3 years, which is a long time.e) Last but the most important is it's price. Such a beautiful TV at 10,999/- and an additional 1,000/- Amazon pay balance is indeed an awesome deal!Cons:a) The only issue I felt is with the sound output. The background score is louder than the dialogues. But if you change the settings it becomes perfectly fine.So this is my honest review regarding the TV. Please go ahead and buy your TV.

  Almost all the points were covered in other reviews from various customers. I don't want to repeat them again.Based on my usage from one week I felt picture clarity is very good, sound is also good. no need to separate speakers unless you want high woofer effects.I had faced issue with promevideo like many other users. I was able to resolve it by resetting the settings. Thanks for the solution by some users in the reviews section.Another issue which I am facing is with Jio cinema. I have installed the Jio Cinema app from the playstore. But I am not able to open the app. I am getting the error, unable to process the request, please try again later.Also I am not able to do casting also from jio cinema app from my mobile.I thought this issue also will be resolved after the system reset. But it didn't.If anybody is facing the similar issue and found any solution, please update.Apart from that all other apps are working fine.It is very good deal from amazon during the great Indian festival.I will add more points after exploring the product in detail.

  This smart TV is bang for your buck for the price that you pay. However, when you say android; you expect it to also have accessibility features. This TV does not support the android accessibility suite or Google Talk Back which is a must have for persons with a print disability.This is my 3rd TV from VU. I started with my first; which was a LCD model and that time I was able to see and was impressed by the finish and the features it offered me as a PlayStation gamer. I got my second TV from VU and it was a LED; I probably used it for 2 to 3 years when I was tempted to go in for a smart or android TV. This got me to this page on amazon and since they had an exchange and offer that I could not refuse, why not I said. Although the exchange price I got for my old TV wasn't impressive.I am very impressed by the way the exchange and installation was carried out; having the challenges of the pandemic; the support staff was very courteous and dispite my disability they were helpful and polite throughout the process.This smart TV has a lot to offer in terms of performance and variety of settings for sound and picture. It also has great ways to connect to accessories via BlueTooth; the remote I am given to understand is a BlueTooth device that runs on 2 AAA batteries. I am impressed that despite not having the accessibility feature in the android system, the remote follows standard design with tactile buttons for the few keys we need immediate access to. Don't understand why they have wasted so much space on the remote for the number pad, they have a separate key for the Play and Pause button; they could have clubbed it into one. The remote has quick access keys to pre-installed apps. like Amazon Prime, HotStar, NetFlix etc. Sorry, forgot to mention; you cannot use the Google Assistant with the remote they give you with the TV; you will have to buy a new one if you want to use the Google Assistant which costs you another 2,500. Overall as I said earlier bang for your buck, but if you are looking for the one accessibility feature that I was, you will be highly disappointed. Sound quality on all the modes not making much of a difference unless set to news, you cannot hear dialogue on any of the movies clearly but you will get the bells and whistles clearly and loud!Conclusion: With the above limitations I would still say, Go for it, it's bang for your buck!

  **This is a genuine review posted by a genuine Customer**Placing Order:I have placed the order during the great Indian festival and got a discount on the original price. I have purchased this TV for 21000. I have also opted out for Acko Insurance.Delivery:I live in a city which is connected by railways and transport very well with the major cities like Hyderabad and Banglore. As the seller cloudtail shipped my product from Greater thane I was pretty sure that I will get delivery within 3 days. But that did not happen. Due to the ongoing sale and Diwali holidays, I have received the product after 8 days.Amazon delivered the product within the deadline.First Impression:After the delivery, I have unboxed the TV and put it on the stand given in the box. The setup of the tv is not that difficult as it is an Android TV. After the whole setup, I quickly jumped to the video qualityVideo:Video quality is better than LG and close to Samsung. Brightness is slightly high but it won't bother you if you are not going to stick to the premium led panels expectations.Audio:Audio quality has impressed me. It is better than the premium rivals. The 20W output is good enough for 10 feet distance.Speed:As it is an android tv, it comes with inbuilt RAM and storage. The 1 GB ram will keep you wait for 30 seconds when you press on from your remote. After 30 seconds the home screen appears. Once you get started there is no such delay in operations.Interface: Interface is stock android and customizable.Connectivity:Wifi, Bluetooth and USB ports works very wellRemote:You can handle the majority of tasks using remote and remote has soft textured keys.Installation:For the installation, I had to call VU customer care to place an installation request. The installation guy came after 1day. He was skilled enough to mount the TV properly. I have found VU customer care good enough till now.Overall Comment:I personally think that as my budget was within 25000 rupees and I wanted a tv with youtube and Full HD capabilities, this one is a good choice and my family doesn't watch the TV whole day. It's a good tv and I suggest this tv if you have a budget within 25000 but don't expect too much like sony or any premium brand as you are buying a product considering the price point. I found this TV fulfilling all my needs. I have chosen this TV over price and I am very satisfied with my choice. I didn't want to purchase a TV worth 44K just to watch for 1 hour.Overall I will rate this TV 4 stars. If brightness is adjusted and some more RAM is given then I would have might give it 5 stars.

  Picture looks average in SD channels (siti cable).Sound is also average in low volume and in high volume sound is distorted.It is a 43inch FHD TV taking the bazzels diagonally.Overall it is a decent product. Overall rating can be 3.5 out of 5.If any one is looking for 43 inch FHD tv then one should opt for VU 43 inch FHD cinema TV for better contrast, higher nits and obviously better sound o/p.

  I received the TV, yesterday which I kept it sealed packed as delivered until the technician came to install. The technician came today (Polite and careful in installation) and did the TV set up process. The wifi wasn’t connecting. It was shutting off automatically in 3-4 seconds. He reset TV to the factory settings still the problem persisted. The technician said it is a defective TV and I should return.Another concern was the TV was full of scratches on the borders. The remote control had the batteries pre installed, which clearly suggest that it was somehow used. Technician said the same. It was disappointing to have this experience. I have asked for refund and it is under process.I think somehow Amazon should make a quality check or make a scrutiny on the supplier. I felt it was a serious waste of time and an unpleasant experience.

  Im giving it an average star of 3. Not because the product it bad or good, ill let you guys know soon, im doing it becoz the tv hasnt been used that much. Firstly Picture quality at this price is a win win. Sound, not so good, but you buy any tv, none of them can give u a feeling, thats why home theatre are build. Functions are a little slow, like change the source or even the andriod applications. Its very light weighted, easy to install like mounting to the wall or the stands provided. Difficulty is in understanding the remote and the functions. Rest i find it good for now. Will get back after using it more.

  i ordered the tv  on 29th sep 2019 and received on 5th oct and installed on 6th oct.the installation guy installed the tv and shown me some operations. after that i started using the tv  .  i purchased this tv  because this tv directly support prime video and hotstar and hot keys given on remote it self. i tried to open hotstar but failed . after lot of brain storming i decided to download the app and i did the same  it gave me a code to verify i followed the procedure and enjoying it. no problems  the same thing happened with zee 5 alssonow the real story starts now  i am not able to open prime video. it is asking me sign in , i did the same and it gave me  a code and with that code i registered my tv. then it allowed me browse the content. when i am opening some movie it is not at all opening  and saying about some error and suggesting contact prime video help. but i could not get any help from that. finally  i thought if i update the software i may find some solution. it 1 hour for me how to update  it.finally i updated it and i am able to watch from prime video. but  very very frustating  point is if you switch off the tv and again you have to re login and verify your tv . this is very very frustating to me so far i made near about 15 login  it is not happening with any other app, why it is happening with prime video . i hope vu and amazon prime video will resolve this problem at the earliest. here i am attaching 5 photos regarding how to update. finally i am giving only four stars  and cutting one star with respect to prime video app. let me check the remaining apps after that i will come back

  Being full HD the picture quality is not that much satisfactory. I have tested with all types of video formats and resolution. Its good but not best. Sound quality is poor. Even though it Dolby digital but inbuilt speakers are poor. I have connected external home theater systems with it. I am very much disappointed and dissatisfied with the Amazon Prime App. The Prime App in the TV is has very limited functionality. I can't set resolutions and can't change the display size and ratio. Hope next update will get this corrected. Other Apps are working fine. Facing issues with WiFi connectivity but no issues when I connect it with LAN. OS is bit slow. As compare with the Price, it a good piece. Hope the TV will last long without any issues. If anyone have tight budget, then go for it.

  My last LED TV was of Samsung brand bought from Singapore. It lasted for 7 years and started giving problems. I bought Vu this time and really liked the picture quality as well as sound. It has all the latest features and hot keys for the apps like YouTube, Hotstar, Netflix, Prime. I was hesitant as my parents(70+ years) may not be able to operate it but they are also comfortable watching programs on YouTube and HotStar.Go for it as it's a great value for money.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

  All is working good here. Its remote has dedicated buttons for Hotstar, Netflix, YouTube and Prime Videos and all are working well.Sound is also amazing and far better than my 42 inches Panasonic viera TV.The only thing that I dint like is its slow response. They must have tested it considering RAM and Processor. When you will press the Volume button, it will take a few milliseconds to show you the volume bar. Similar response you will get when you will try to make any setting changes into it.All apps working well and few are slow in response like SonyLiv crashes sometimes. This all is because of the low memory of TV.Another issue I am facing that the TV doesn't connect my external Bluetooth speaker. It shows it in available devices but doesn't pair.

  So I have been using this since February. The remote does not have voice input feature. I used my Google Home mini to control the volume, Netlfix, Prime and Gaana. For Hotstar there is no support for voice commands.Bluetooth is good, although you have to unpair and repair when you're using it after sometime. Sound quality is wanting, when you play something some parts have too loud output while the dialogues are too low in volume. Sometimes it hangs and behaves weirdly, not sure if it's an app issue or the TV's.Picture quality is good, but Chrome Cast lags A LOT!! You cannot cast movies more VLC or other media..works for Hotstar and Spotify though, no lag there.

  I ordered for the VU 80 CMS LED TV and the Amazon delivery was really amazing experience.Now coming to the VU TV itself, it is a well-designed intelligent product. It performs well, connections are easy, the blue-tooth connectivity is also great. It sits pretty. I use this both as a monitor for my LAPTOP is great for WFH. I also connect my TATASKY Settop box through one of the two HDMI inlets.The remote that controls the VU is simplicity itself by design and is very handy to use.If the size is OK for a home, you can use this as a TV as well as a monitor. But for a home viewing, this size is rather small. When you need a dual-purpose display unit, nothing else would stand up to VU. Go for it. Rotarian PROF. E.I. Ravindranath

  Pros:1) Picture and Sound Quality is really Good a d besf for viewing at distance of 4 feet.2) Android TV system UI operates smothly.3) Got it in RS 10349 during sale and also got RS 1000 in amazon pay as Cashback so Its a value for money product. So good for starters.Cons:1) There is no Google Voice Assistant in remote so this is a big problem for me. I have to use my phone using Android TV app downloaded from Play Store to use voice assistant using bluetooth (You can also use WiFi) but even it doesn't work well like I can't use it to search using voice on YouTube. Full review soon. Need fix in Android TV UI.2) Dual core processor is not enough for this TV as it is slow in opening apps.3) Screen sharing/mirroring lags using Redmi Note 5 Pro phone but my phone cast fine with laptop so its TV problem.My verdict: If you are tight on budget go for this TV as it has very good picture quality.

  I recently brought VU TV. I was so impressed with the functionality and the clarity of the Pictures. The Android in VU tv works flawlessly. I also have MI tv which is basically crap with lot of bugs in Android. There are lot of TV apps not working properly in MI Tv. Also VU in terms of power consumption has 4 stars compared to MI TV which has just 1 star.So I would advice people to buy VU tv rather than MI tv. Only disadvantage in VU tv is they do not have voice recognition. But if you install firestick I think you can solve that too.

  Amazing product from VU...This is my first Smart HD TV, and I realize what I have been missing all these years.... It's a beautiful looking TV, Picture Quality is life like (at recommend viewing distant), Sound is ample enough to fill a room with crisp and clear output (don't spend money buying a sound bar for this TV) and the apps are pretty Swift and easy to navigate (I mean not as swiftly as you can on your laptop or phones, but you'll get the hang of it). Only miss is the voice control remote, would have saved a lot of time typing the content name and don't even think of the Android TV remote its uselessBut Overall it's definitely an outright winner in the price range of 20k

  UPDATE: Apr 21, 2020Vu's service team fixed the TV soon after my review. Apparently it needed a software upgrade which somehow couldn't happen online but the service guy had to do it using his flashdrive. Most of the issues are now fixed. I still do not like the sound system, but otherwise the TV is serving its purpose for now. Wonder why new purchases couldn't have had the latest software updates installed already. I'd still deduct 2 stars for the sound quality.ORIGINAL POST: Mar 11, 2020I don’t regret any other Amazon purchase as I do for this Vu TV. I am someone who buys low-cost brand’s TVs because I like upgrading every few years. I had a 40” Micromax non-smart/standard TV for the last 3 years and it worked like a charm. I liked the picture quality and the sound and it worked decently with my Firestick. Then I decided to upgrade to a smart tv and not rely just on my Firestick for streaming apps. Oh boy, why did I choose Vu! Issues with this smart TV: the screen goes blank/black randomly, doesn’t matter if you are streaming over the web or casting a video from your laptop. There was a short powercut and it messed up the volume of the TV when it turned on. I could volume up to 100% and could hear as if it’s only 20% volume. The other day the home screen loaded in just half of the screen. You can’t hear the sound well in the room but every other faraway room gets the sound from the TV pretty loudly, no it’s not a messed up sound setting, we tried them all. Responsiveness to remote operations is slow too.Unfortunately, I was travelling and the return window expired by the time I discovered all these issues. I seriously regret buying  this. For economical brands, please look elsewhere. Now I fear how the post-sale service will be for this brand.

  Vu ultra 32 inch smart tv review :Bought it for 11.8K and it is worth every penny. The smart features are excellent. Audio options are good. Some of you may feel, the voice is not enhanced but the music is. You need to adjust options in sound settings. Picture quality is good but the default picture option is too bright. Let's see pros and consPros : Picture quality, Sound options, Smart features, Quick app change options, Google home, Chromecast is quick, multimedia plays most of the formatsCons : Takes time after turning on (from total switch off), volume displays with a time lag when you increase or reduce, voice search is not working at all.Overall, a safe bet to buy and this is the best tv under 12k without even an inch of a doubt.

  When I was booking this TV there was no ratings but now I could see plenty of negative comments, To be honest I do not know giving a positive rating at this juncture is correct or not as it is too early to judge/comment, but in my personal opinion on my last 2 days experience the product is very good for its price tag and the working features with the device.Secondly I've gone through all negative reviews and compared it with my TV, unfortunately none of them are valid, Prime is perfectly registered and we finished watching 2 full movie as well.  But yes couple of vital things are missing ""Mic enabled remote"" and ""Bluetooth"" with some hiccups here and there but eventually the product is phenomenal in my 2 days experience.

  Bought this 32"" Android TV during Dussehra Sale for a meagre amount which was little less than even 10K. Firstly it was delivered well on time and When I opened the package, I was impressed with the looks. Installation itself is damn easy and I mounted it on the wall. Picture quality, sound quality is awesome and ease of configuring the set with your mobile and broadband is extremely user friendly. The remote has user-friendly keys for direct access to Amazon prime, Netflix, hotstar, YouTube and Google Play. It can be connected by HDMI, USB , cables and even with the phones using MIRACAST. The response to Internet is crisp and overall it's a value for money. I presume that customer support mechanism too should be good because I received mails and phone calls ascertaining about the product satisfaction.

Especially if you plan to wall mount the TV3. Picture quality cannot be adjusted while casting from mobile. Sometimes it becomes very darkRest the TV is fast and smooth and will not disappoint much.

  Got the product for 10,349 after discount. Picture quality is very good in this price range.  Sound quality is also good for a small room. Few drawbacks which i noticed after 10days of usage are1. Zee5 app is crashing2. Even if you sign in to amazon prime, once you come out of the app and  go back it asks to sign in again.3. Overall i felt the response of the apps are little slow. Could have been little faster. I dont notice this in my TCL 55inch TV.

  This is the second review I am submitting on the purchase done 3 weeks back. 1st review amazon has removed it, not sure why as i have given 1 star since the installation team kept on changing the dates and eventually we didn't want the return period to be get over without checking if the TV is working. We have installed it ourselves. Apart from the installation, we are satisfied with the VU tv. Picture quality is superb, not sure why people comment with issues such as prime videos not working. One thing to note is either they don't have an amazon prime purchased or they don't know how to connect to TV. We have not tried other apps yet other than prime videos and youtube. But we are happy to select VU.Will update on other features after we for another month.Would have given 5 star if we had the installation done by the installation team.

  Very Good Deal, picture and sound quality is good. Connectivity is seamless (WiFi, Bluetooth, Casting), package included a wall mount.Took a while to resolve the Amazon Prime app issue. The issue is that after login to Amazon Prime app, it will ask additional registration on primevideo/mytv site. Even after registering, the app doesn't proceed further. This issue was resolved after following the 2 steps:1. System Update (Settings, About the Phone, System Update)2. If the above doesn't solve, do a factory reset. (Settings, About the Phone, Reset)

  No Google Assistant support within Remote unlike other Android TV from Mi, Tcl and othersAt times UX is not very smooth. Also app data gets cleared sometimes on update so requiring re login into app.It is a growing brand like Mi and others in budget segment and so are still learning.Products are not perfect like Sony, LG etc and random issues are there which are not very frequent though.Customer support is prompt though. Issues are there but they provide bug fixes to mitigate many of those.Product quality and performance is somewhat satisfying according to the price range. Dont expect perfection like bigger brands though.Overall you dont regret buying it at this budget since most useful features are there.

  Amazing TV set. And you get 200% more than the paid value. The picture quality is unbelievably clear and the sound is pretty decent. Remote quality is top notch and it works in any direction. The amazon, netflix, hotstar, youtube shortcut buttons on the remote control adds charms to it. Android is flawless and responsively swift. I have installed dozen of apps, yet the performance is intact.Overall it’s an amazing product and thanks to amazon for timely delivery. And best part is its not a chinese product. Go for it.

  Ordered this tv on Friday evening. Got it for around 17300 rs after applying all eligible discounts.It got delivered on Saturday morning. The installation was requested for Sunday morning but as the installation person was in same area on Saturday evening, installation was complete on Saturday itself.From Amazon part, delivery and installation was before time 🙂Now coming to the product,Considering price, it is truly amazing. The bazels are reasonably thin, TV is quite slim as well.Panel is very bright (due to the fact that vu uses Direct led panels instead of edge led), color reproduction is more on a saturated side but overall good. Viewing angles are also fine. So overall picture quality is good. Not a big fan of cricket so can't comment on cricket mode.Sound quality is good but not that great. When surround sound is on, music tends to become loud which makes the vocals muffled. I use home theatre so this doesn't bother me.As this is pure android tv, it has got a stock android interface which i like over custom interfaces like patchwall is web os. Navigation is almost smooth. Remote is not the bluetooth one but still works well. Voice recognition is not supported by remote but can be done using android tv remote app on Google Play. It has dedicated buttons for Netflix, YouTube, prime video, bistar and Google Play which works well.Doesn't lag even after having only 1 gb of ram, probably that it due to stock android. It is running Android 9 out of the box which is good.Prime video works fine after a reset!Overall this is a good budget smart tv if you don't want fancy things like HDR10, voice remote and all which in practicality never used.

  TV exceeded my expectations. I primarily went for this TV as an easy substitute for my kid's nursery rhymes and an alternate viewing options for homemade videos. But the picture quality is quite good with an easy interface to use with most popular choices (Netflix, Amazon Prime, YT and Hotstar ) already built with a single button access.The installation guy guided us with the necessary details for a seamless experience.

  I am quite happy with my purchase of Vu 40GA. The picture quality of this tv is very good with wonderful rendition of HD content. The sound quality though depends a great deal on the source.  Bluetooth connectivity, playback from USB drives, casting from smart phone all work well. Even composite input from an old DVD player via an old A/V cable gets reproduced without any hitch.The only thing lacking is mic support on the remote for Google Assistant. Had it been present, it would have been a perfect addition to the hotkeys for Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube and Google Play on the remote.

What the...,"

  Hi,I say this with a heavy heart but even at this price range- a brand should not be seeking a TV with sound that is inaudible. It’s a shame that the audio cracks/bursts even at 20 percent volume. I think there’s a defect when it comes to bass. Happens on all video apps and channels.Yes the TV is slim, has a decent UI, comes with good picture clarity but it’s all useless if the sound quality is shambolic. Quite disappointed that VU is marketing this product with claims of Dolby Audio output when it can’t even give you CRT level clarity for now. Don’t know what to do with the piece during this lockdown now. My ears hurt thinking about how bad the sound can get on this TV.

  Initially i was hesitant to buy VU brand. But this is for my parents , the were using old CRT TV.so wanted to upgrade it.Confusion between vu,MI,micromax,tcl and Santo. But many social media ppl replied with VU tv  with half mind. Even i got offer for LV TV around 13k. But already i had LG TV, it was having diplay issue. Every 2 years, inside led plastics fell off. And spent 5000 every two years. So i don't want to go for LG brand. And ordered this vu android latest TV. Since it's new to the market, I didn't get many reviews. With half minded i ordered. Tv reached earlier than expected (remote village in Tamilnadu)..But installation didn't happen at scheduled time. 4 days later.  So i saw my TV installed 2 days back only. Its not HD but HD Ready. But quality of video is perfect HD for 32 inches. Played Netflix and YouTube videos seamlessly...Many ppl reviewed other VU branda having low volume...no... Its sound volume is more than expected. For my family its enough. Dolby effect also gud . ( if u need more effect pls go for home theatre) Netflix, hotstar and YouTube with remote buttons, we can get easily. ( in hotstar i couldn't able to select subtitles)I reduced one star because, amazon prime button in remote. But its having login issues. Even though we registered out TV in amazon page, I can't run amazon prime in this TV.But its having Inbuilt Chromecast. So u can cast all from ur mobile to TV.Now i can't tell abt durability, but its worth for every penny...I think VU is cheap and best. Simply go for it ❤❤❤❤update on 08Jan2020:**************************I checked after two months.. amazon prime login issue got resolved. I donno how. Now amazon prime also working fine.

  I got it delivered in time... so the delivery aspect is very good. If you are buying this product for ""NETFLIX"" or ""AMAZON PRIME"" please please please think twice.... or thrice... For me It worked for two days.. then whenever i try to connect i get a message with some error code (even the codes are not same every time... some random error codes) which seems to blame the network. All my devices are working fine, at least no network issues. All other apps including YouTube is working just fine. Since the remote has dedicated buttons for the above said two apps, expecting them to work perfectly is fair and those apps not working is unfair.

  Absolutely brilliant! I was little skeptical about buying it since it was offering so much for so little. Its a 32 inch smart tv which offers great colours and contrast and surprisingly the white balance offered is good at this price. Sound quality is fine though not great. Smart TV features are working smoothly (youtube, Amazon prime, sonyliv ) i had no issues while launching applications or while streaming them infact i can compare it with my firestick which i have for my other room. It also has a  blutooth receiver as well The build quality is more than acceptable. It doesn't feel clumsy at all, the provided Remote is also sturdy and its buttons are responsive.  The only thing which is at the downside is the OSD menu which could have been better in terms of screen positioning and the user interface ... Anybody who wants to buy a smart tv should not think twice ..just go for it ! Its a steal at the current discounts and offers ..

  Amazon prime plays only HD Video in 720p but Tv has 1080p display. The sound is Not properly come out through tv for 2-3 starting minutes on Amazon prime. The blutooth range is not good. I am standing infront of Tv about 1-2 meter away and my wireless headphones is not working properly . The sound in headphones are coming into pieces means not coming properly.Tv pictures quality is okay and sound is okay too. Sometimes if you play Full HD video , there is no sound coming out from it.When I first started TV , It was hanged and laggy then I did factory reset two to three times then the tv navigation works properly. I want to turn off the sound of navigation but I didn't find any option into this tv . Overall Tv is nice if you ignore these problems. Please fix sound problem in TV's Next OTA update.

  Best deal for the price. I have bought this one since I can get prime videos on iffalcon TCL TV or else I would have purchased their own already got 40 inches iffalcon tv.BUT, this one has Prime Videos so it's a bonus for our family.Pros:* Picture quality.* Performance is fast (exception: prime videos is a slow app in itself)* Looks great with thinner bezels* Many advanced settings for changing picture quality* Voice search (not every smart tv offers this feature)Cons:* Sound quality - bizzare (if you're used to of listening to external speakers with good quality - you can take about half hour to 1 hour to accept the average sound quality subconsciously)* No shortcut button for opening picture quality settings on the fly while any app is opened. Must go to home the fiddle with many menus to get there.* Voice search is supported by Android TV Control app but for some reason, it opens text search even though I press mic button for a voice search. I must go to HOME and then manually choose voice search then use my phone for voice search.Verdict:Go for it! You'll not regret it once you've found the picture quality settings as per your liking (no further changes needed, no menu navigation hassle). And if you have external speakers - sound quality issue is gone as well. Even if you don't have external speakers for some reason - yours ears get used to the sound within 15 minutes. Just focus on the content rather than the audio. :D Voice search isn't much big of a requirement as it's usability is limited.Suggestion: With such a cheap TV, a good sound bar or speaker system will turn this into a great bedroom home theater system. ;)

  The looks of the TV is good. SMART feature navigation is also good.Sound quality of this TV definitely needs improvement where most of the sound gets distorted with fading or multiple sound. When I have seen multiple review in youtube, no one talked about this noise distortion part. If anyone is buying this TV, they should plan to buy one sound bar as well.VU should work on the voice based search part and the sound quality of this TV.

  VU promotes surround sound, dolby audio etc but in reality even at 100% volume speakers are not much audible in living room. Plus speakers are not at clear. Audio is 1/5.Video quality is pretty average and does not justify full HD etc as mentioned at all. You will be able to see difference if you compare with actual full hd tv next to this tv which people hardly do.I understand its a budget brand and budget product but marketing is misleading for mass sales.

  It's been 10 days and so far my experience with VU Ultra Android range has been phenomenal. The picture quality is really vibrant and vivid. The colours are perfect in this range. The display is far better than it's competitors and also the colours seem pretty natural.Coming to the sound section, the 20W surround sound Dolby system is absolutely mind blowing. The voice is clear and the music just mellows your ears. The bass and everything is pretty good and at this price point everything works phenomenal.Netflix works perfectly. Every other Android supported application runs the same. The Chromecast feature also works flawlessly.The only issue I have faced is with Amazon Prime video. The TV supports the app. But the app has not been registered with Vu TVs till now. So registering of the device doesn't work. So using amazon video works currently with Chromecast feature only.Apart from this everything is perfect.

Netflix, Prime video, hotstar, youtube among others. Users have been facing issue with accessing primevideo, but the latest Ota update solves the problem. Just update and do a factory reset.Viola it works!The sound is decent as well. You can pair bluetooth headset as well. The inbuilt speakers are also decent for a small room.Over all a quality tv for the price. Go for it.

  Been using this tv since 3 months. No problems till now, works great, sometimes lags but that's not the big problem considering the price you paying. Picture quality is great too. SD channels look descent but I suggest opt for HD channels. Viewing angles are also good colours do wash out a little if viewed from corner. Otherwise it's definitely a bang for buck. If you're planning to buy a 40 inch budget TV don't look anywhere and straight away go for this (this tv is better than mi 40 inch tv). VU itself will send you extended warranty of 3 years details through email (For my case it cost me 1770  Rs for the extended warranty). If you want to buy 43 inch variant of this tv i suggest you stretch out a little and go for the pixelight series of VU available on Flipkart.Cheers

  Purchased VU 43"" Smart TV from Amazon and I pretty impressed with everything so far right from price, delivery, service and features.1) Price- I bought this TV at a price of ₹20,000 from Amazon. I would say that this the best price for such aTV with so many features.2) Delivery- On time delivery without any chaser calls or anything. I was getting status of delivery on real time basis.3) Service/Installation- Installation guy himself called me without me calling Amazon customer care. He came on time, installed it well amd explained all features to me in detail.4) Product- Sound and Picture quality very good. You can connect bluetooth speakers as well. Response time is less than 5 secs which is fine.Overall verdict- I rate 5 stars for the product. Rated 1 star as this tv does not support voice recognition. But that's ok you can still search for your favourite songs and videos.

  I took 32 inch TV and I see back light bleed on the lower right and left corners of the TV, android features are okay although they are not way too responsive and the voice recognition is not happening. I am thinking to replace it to see it is only for this item or not. Hope the replacement happens smoothly. Adding a picture of TV where you can clearly see backlight bleeding for reference.

  I bought this after comparing it with many other branded TVs such as Samsung, Xiaomi, LG, Motorola, etc. But finally decided to buy this because it's an Indian brand and the features and quality it offers are comparable to those Big brands as Samsung and LG and can easily beat Chinese made TVs in terms of display and sound quality & clarity. I recommend this TV to all those who are in a tight budget but want a really good picture quality and sound in a TV that too from an Indian Brand. Also, the latest Android 9.0, Bluetooth 5.0, and Chromecast works very well. The interface is easy to operate. Also, you get five shortcut keys for each streaming media (Hotstar, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Youtube) in remote itself, so no hassle. I faced no connectivity issues so far. As far as voice control is concerned, one can use their smartphones to operate their tv via Google Assistance, you just need to download the Google assistance app and apply settings to it.

  After a weeks usage, i find this as an excellent choice for its picture quality and sound. For me sound is adequate as i use it in my bedroom. As it is a VA panel, i have installed it in a straight position, but i do watch from an angle without any issues. I can assure u need not require any Samsung or Sony for picture quality. VU is well above my expectation. I had a 40inch 3D Full HD Samsung 7 series smart tv in 2012 which i imported for nearly 75k. Even that tv lasted for 7yrs and almost never used 3D goggles and content, gesture commands and smart tv features. So in my opinion dont overspend for electronics which keeps on updating. nd go for a mediocre one. A value for money piece. You can very well go for this tv if you want to gift your dad or mom a tv for bed time watch. At 11k its really value for money. Amazon prime works flawlessly after the update. Disney+ Hotstar app is installable as it is an android tv. Only downside i find was about voice recognition as remote does not support it.

My Fancy Name Goes Here,"

  The initial order had a picture tube defect, so i got it replaced with a brand new TV. The overall build quality and experience is pretty decent in this price range. Just a few things to note for new users:1. For regular viewing, use ""Sports"" preset for Sound and ""Movie"" mode for watching anything from Netflix to DTH.2. For playing games on PS4 like I do, use ""Standard"" mode under video settings.3. If you feel the contrast is too high and the exposure is too low especially for dark colours like black, play around with the colour configuration a bit and you'll figure it out.If you're able to figure out colour and picture settings for different inputs and outputs, you'll enjoy this product. Else it can be a nightmare especially if you're moving from Samsung or Panasonic to this TV for regular viewing.Also, bluetooth is laggy at times, but it's not that bad. Only issue is every time you've got to pair again and again for some reason, which can be frustrating, especially if you use the same bluetooth headphones with other devices as well. The bluetooth audio levels are also pretty low no matter how good your headphones are.But all of this is just a little bit of sacrifice I'd say, when you look at the specs of the product and compare those with the price at which they're being offered by other competitors.My whole idea of buying this product was to hook up my PS4, and it is serving the purpose well. I can even tell a big difference between running stock YouTube and Netflix via PS4 on this TV, versus when I run the in-built YouTube and Netflix in this smart TV. Sony is again a different class altogether, but VU isn't that bad either for this price. All in all, a very good deal and decent product from an Indian company! :)

  The product is of very good quality,picture and sound quality is excellent according to price,screen cast/mirror is very slow responding,youtube video plays effortlessly, the installation guy didn't have good knowledge about product,he only knows how to wall mount the TV. Delivery time is very long. Also have MI 43 inch 4a tv and VU had better picture and sound quality. Rest update after more use.

After complaining somany times to Amazon, installation team members called me not came to my house. I installed the TV with my own knowledge. Picture quality is superb. Sound is average. But smart features are not good. Downloading of new apps is not taking place. Chromecast is not working well. I suggest to buy a new model VU TV for better working of smart features.

  Affordable Android powered Smart TV from VU having A+ grade panel, which is what you everyone should care for. Screen quality and color reproduction are really good. I'm wondering how they are shipping this at such a cost compared to the competitors.Smart TV features are all packed which Android TV OS offers. Only thing I didn't find not working is the voice command input but it's not a deal breaker for me, as I paid nearly half of what other brands are charging.

Slim and sleek5. PriceCons.Terrible, like seriously worst tv speakers ever period. If you don't have extra 7-8 grands to put on a sound bar or home theatre system don't buy this tv. Horible experience while watching movies. But for browsing yourube and all its a good stuff. Vu needs  to work on tv speaker's. Good product if only you put extra money to buy sound system.

  Very worst poor quality of voice like buzzing, Jarring or something like touching on speaker, which very irritating. Only picture quality is ok.I am having problem of buzzing/irritating sound from very first day when I bought, we tried to contact on customer care more than 100 times but never got connected and always we choose reply of will call back. But never got reply call from VU customer care.After that I found WhatsApp number where I made a compliant on 24th July complaint no. VU725507. Person visited and updated software but no outcome and was left unsolved.Again I made complaint on WhatsApp and service executive had given me various excuse over the phone with solution that test on pendrive and said don’t use Tata sky. Also he said me use TV at other switch board. We used all mehtods but nothing solved.We have no news from anyone and even given WhatsApp number also telling we only take registrations and customer care number never get connect.I feel we are being cheated by VU TV. Definitely not recommended.I have only hope if Amazon take action after seeing my post against VU tv, since amazon is promoting this company.

  I got the 40 inch Vu Smart android TV and it is just awesome at this price. I bought it in amazon sale. Initially all the apps(Netflix, Youtube, Hotstar, Zee5) were working fine expect prime video which was disappointing but the installation guy installed some update of 840 MB, reset the TV settings and then all apps were working smoothly. The clarity is amazing and is visible clearly from any angle. Though I was not impressed with the sound but that can be ignored as most of the TV's do not have awesome sound. I have compensated that with JBL soundbar and now its superb experience for me.For this price range this Vu TV fulfills all the criteria and if you want are planning to buy go for this.

Very easy to operate even for elders.Audio is not as great as sony or samsung but rest is beyond expectations.Amazing product!! Highly recommended.Although it's clearly mentioned voice search is not available, voice search is visible in tv but remote has no input. Technician said remote need to be updated with new model as per 2019. So have requested amazon they have put another technician visit. But even if voice search is not there it's a superb product.Apps like android tv works with voice search from phone but only operates on built in tv and hotstar not on other apps.

Worst sound experience: you will have to use external sound device like sound bar or Bluetooth speakers. Sound is seriously worst in this tv.2. No mic in the remote so that you can use voice search.

  After a long research from internet decided to buy Vu Ultra Android TV 40 inches which also fits in budget.I have waited a long to get 10% Discount through my Card. Finally Product delivered in January 2020.Pros:1. Definately the Picture Quality with Vivid colour.2. Brightness of the screen. Need to lower the brightness to keep my eyes stress free.3. Sound quality is good. I don't need to turn on Fenda 2.1 sound system. Some users complaint about a humming sound for high bass, but don't get panic, it's common with all LED TV, even I have seen the same on Samsung.4. Can play almost all types of video files through pen drive. Now, I have stopped my movie outing !Cons:1. After installation, noticed a cloth type meterial comes out from TV screen in left hand side. Ask Amazon for replacement, they replaced. But surprisingly, the replacement TV also have the same issue. (See picture, marked in red box)2. Lagging during casting my mobile. (I don't use it much)3. Booting Time high.4. Sometime sound becomes lowered by itself, slove after a reboot.5. As it comes with VA panel, viewing angle is not good.In short, it's a good purchase as compared to its price with other branded TV like Samsung and LG.

Set it up in half an hour and left.. Very courteous and no riff raff.Very easy to install apps as well.. I have Netflix, Prime, Hotstar, Zee, JioTv, Spotify and few more.. All work seamlessly once it has been setup.Video quality is very sharp and colors are quite vivid.Can couch for Audio being perfect for bedroom watching.Issues - There is some lag, when switching from one app to another.. It's not as seamless as say watching TV with a set top box.. Surprising since it using Android Pie.Also I can see the bidding/glue in the top corner that was used to paste the frame onto the glass.

  The installer came and gave a quick demo but was not equipped to activate the voice recognition feature. Hence I have given a blank rating on that.The screen cast / mirroring experience is pathetic. The audio is immediately casted from my Android phone to the TV, but the pictures follow after a delay of over 20 secs. I have absolutely no delay when I use a Chromecast device cast fitted on a normal (non-Smart) Sanyo TV over the same wi-fi network.The users manual is also below expectation. It does not even mention the exact model of the TV set purchased.  So I am left wondering whether they made a packing mistake or just don't care about perfection.

  Bought this set for my parents during Diwali sale and its worth every penny! Be it picture or sound quality, considering price range (₹ 11000) it is fantastic. Keep in mind that some ""mid-range"" phones are more expensive. :PTimely delivery by Amazon amd service engineer quickly helped with initial setup!It runs on Android Pie (9) and comes pre-installed with Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube. I found prime video to crash initially, however after updating OS , it worked fine.If you are looking for a budget TV, i would strongly recommend to go with this !

  Using it for last one week . Good experience as of now. No voice recognition . but Tv is always shows the details of that feature. I think the software is same for higher variant also. YouTube plays really good. Very good picture clarity. Sound is really good in pre installed app but not so good with dish tv

  This is the best deal you can get from an Indian market at your budget. It's to have a 43 inch TV at this affordable price. One thing I am still worried about is that I am unable to screen share/connect my iPhone to Vu TV. It would be great if the manufacturer shares any docs to do the same. The rest all is great with them. Thanks!

  The main disappointment is that VU TV doesn't support Prime Video app as stated by the listing on Amazon. Amazon claims that VU Tv is not supported for prime Video. If yes, why list it in the first place? Very misleading. After multiple calls to VU and Amazon, am using a Fire Stick for apps like Prime Video, Sony LIV.For the price it is a good buy. Proper delivery and installation by Amazon. Kudos to that!

  Picture quality is fantastic from the right distance bcoz it's full hd tv, u can't watch it from very close to the tv. Voice recognition is there but remote doesn't support that. U can download google official app 'Android TV Remote Control' in your smartphone that will help for voice recognition. Chromecast feature is also a headache in this tv but can be downloaded one more app called 'Google Home' in your smartphone and that will help u for screen cast, with that u can watch all the things of your smartphone in that big screen of the tv. Best thing about Vu TV is u get table stand and wall mount bracket in the box. There is no installation charges for it by the company.

  I have brought this TV from here, initially, I had lot of problems especially with AUDIO...  Got replacement as well but the problem continued. Lots of Engineers came and gone with no improvement.Post giving harsh comment then finally Head of VU called up to understand the problem. Then, at last, they provided apatch upgrade and factory reset of the product. Finally, the product started working well.Best part VU as well agreed they had a fault in the product related to sound. It takes great guts as SAY it to a customer. They sent across the a field engineer to run upgrade. Now I am a happy customer.

  Firstly, I wanted to thank Amazon for exceptional customer service, secondly, I certainly tab on back for choosing VU TV. This is an ultra-premium product at a meagre cost. At a cost of 19K, 43 inches LED, can't even dream of it. Just blindly go with the product. It's phenomenal. The only drawback is the sound quality is good but, not outstanding. It is with all the LED segments including renowned brands. If you add an additional soundbar perhaps, it'll give a theatrical experience. The colour mix of the TV is premium better than many renowned brands. Just go for it!!!

  This is a great product at the given price. The quality of picture, sound its great. The only issue I have with this TV is that it’s a bit slow when it boots up for 5 minutes when you could see some lags happening but once the system is fully loaded it works flawlessly. Not sure why google assistant doesn’t work in this.

  It's been only 2 months since I bought the TV, and it is started to getting Off automatically, and volume increases automatically. I mean the TV could not last for 2 months also. It's a proper loot from Amazon. Please return money back, coz I don't want such TV which has problems in 2 months only..

  Pic quality is good audio also good but not great. All applications are working seemlessly. I think it's good to buy at this price range and better than MI tv. Amazon delivery is as fast as always but still I faced the installation troubles, the technician just drilled the wall and fixed the tv also boot the TV that's it and then he went. He is not having time to explain about the features, Amazon should send the knowledgable technician to customers.

  If your looking for something cheap but does the job in a very 2020 way then go for it. 1080p looks good enough, sound quality is not it's strong point though you can connect some other speaker and it will be close to perfect.

  The TV is very competetively priced and worth purchasing it because it has most of the smart features that a TV must have in this era.Though I have a problem with the viewing angels which might be a problem with a few people but considering the price point, it's a deal breaker.

  Picture quality is good (not so good compared to my 8 years old Samsung FHD LCD) . Apps works perfectly but some slowness is experienced. Sound quality is clear (tried every possible combination). Build quality is very poor, can see the gap between the screen and the bazels. Provided 3 star for the build quality and sound .

  When VU launched in India with LCD screen, i was impressed by there picture quality during that time. My First LCD was from VU which didn't gave issue for good 7 Years. After that it started giving LCD panel issue and went blank. Since Technologies changed LED gave better quality i thought to go for the VU LED TV. These was the second from VU, which i bought 2 years back. Today as i Write this second VU product gave the same issue, LED Panel display has gone blank. When the VU technician visit to check the issue, the option given is to replace the Display Panel. Which cost equivalent to new one. Also they have scripted answer, with Humidity /moisture this are common issues. I read some of the blogs this is one of the common issue reported by other user. With 2 experience by now the hefty cost for repair, i would recommend anyone to please give a second thought before buying VU products and life span of display. As on today VU have discontinued both the products which I had bought.

  This TV has everything in it and it's definitely worth every penny spent on it. Be it build Quality( doesn't look cheap rather its very sturdy),picture( excellent..deeper blacks, natural color reproduction), Sound (24 watts speaker are powerful and clear) or smart features..all installed dedicated apps works flawlessly).. Only drawback is casting is some what sluggish and no dedicated voice search key on remote..About durability it's a bit early to tell anything but you can rely upon vu..

  Bought this in sale with a good discount of 10% off at https://amzn.to/2q1hWkK.New TV in 2019 from VU brand. It is Android smart tv with 1 year product warranty. Comes with pre-installed PRIME VIDEO. This is a good deal as other brand TVs are overpriced in this category. Really a value for money product, gives good video and sound quality at this price. Inbuilt Chromecast, Bluetooth and all other features are working well.Can say it’s a best smart Android LED TV with tight budgets. Performance of TV is as per the expectation. Sound quality is great, no need to buy external sound system unless you are sound freak. Amazon delivery & installation is good. Patch wall is simple and easy to use. Videos are sharp and well balanced.If you could stretch your budget a bit, my advice is to go with TCL 4K UHD from here https://amzn.to/2P4JPm8 for getting even more & greater quality.Anyways, few PROS and CONS from my side to be shared:PROS1. Build and look is classy & premium remote.2. Viewing distance of 10-15 feet.3. Comes with the strong wall mount brackets.4. Super clarity and colour reproduction works pretty well.5. Pre-installed apps are working fine.6. Play store provides tons of other options.7. Good quality from sound system.CONS1. Sometimes Android and apps get crashed.2. Phone mirroring works but lags by a few seconds.3. Voice search is missing.4. Needs factory reset for Amazon prime to work.

  Superlike! Amazing product. First of all this is an android tv. So most of the apps are available like Amazon, Netflix, Hotstar, Zee5, Discovery, Hoichoi TV, Gaana etc. The apps are working fine without any update. Games also available from google playstore. Nice quality of pictures. Sound quality is ok. Supports Bluetooth, joystick and external speakers. So u can buy it without any hesitation.

  Best Tv at this price range. Awesome picture quality and sound of the Tv. Everything is working fine. Only thing that is missing is the voice assistant on the remote. I hope the voice assistant smart Vu remote (not any android apps) will be available in few days. And equally good service by Amazon and Vu. If you want to go for it surely try it.

  Guys. This is a HD Ready TV. Which means it supports HD with the help of a HD Media Box. I suggest you guys buy a Full HD TV instead but it costs more. And other things is that a Smart TV can make problems in the future. The OS can crash or the pre installed apps can make problems too. It's always better to buy a Normal Full Hd Tv and an alternate Android Media Box. This will help you from cost cutting for sure. The other problem is ,smart tv's are like a Mini Computer with Processor and ram. So don't forget to use a UPS for the LED TV's. Or else the life of the Backlight LED's will be lesser and will cost you a lot.

  This brand is cheap offers worst service. I've had a problem with Vu TV panel in no less than a couple of years. On top of that their chief officer in India is irresponsible too she didn't bother to reply to our complaint. The panel was all over in just a few months and can you believe it that they offered no service to it. There are multiple complaints from the Vu users about the panel issue. It is not recommended brand at all. Don't buy this brand if you love hard earned money.

  Yes, It is a value for money product. If you have budget constraints, go for this TV without hesitation.The delivery was on time, even though the same was during Covid-19 situation. The delivery agent as well as customer service personnel were wearing required PPE.I would say, for the money I spent,  the product quality was good.This is more of a bedroom TV.If you have a decent broadband connection at home I think its a good choice.Chromecast is working fine.The start delay is almost 10 seconds.Features are all good.Satisfactory purchase. Especially when you are buying a TV for your parents, and they are not so much into specs/gaming and not bothered to change the quality of the video streaming.

We are getting verticle lines on screen..with no external reason...Techician said there was a panel problem and to replace it the company is charging 33,000/- .

  These folks must not know what picture quality a 4k TV should deliver. And yes I know this is a 16k TV. You're better off buying one with 720 or 1080p with a better brand. The picture quality is horrible. ( Writing this review on my American Amzn acct, cos my brother purchased one of these disasters for my parents vacation home in goa on his acct).

  I just bought this TV from amazon a month back and the TV has two basic issues:1. The sound quality is pathetic - the various modes of sounds mentioned like Movie, Audio, Standard etc do not work .. while watching a movie - sound is super high at the time a song is played and super low when there is a conversation.2. The remote does not have an unbuild audio speaker, making it difficult for the user to type everything unlike the features in amazon fire stick.

Next day"" was their response. So we had to postpone our activities and journeys for a week because they keep telling the ""next day"". Each day I had to explain the situation to a new guy(or girl). 2 of them were kind of rude. 1 was very helpful- he escalated the issue or something. They could have given a solid date is all I am saying. Plus they won't allow us to open. It was a big headache. I had to take the blame for not buying from a showroom from my family Anyways it all worked out.The installation guy was alright.Thank you

  I have recently ordered and got 40Inches , just in time before the lockdown . I would say i am happy with the product so far . Infact i had read the reviews about issues with Prime Video , when the person to install the TV came , i had my broad band powered ON.It took an auto-update and after that Prime Video is working fine , i am not sure whether the update did the trick or the issue has been resolved in the new TV sets but its working .One things i also experienced is lack of skills in service personnel . But the Product is cool and good quality and as per todays need , you can watch your DTH channels and the digital contents in the same set with an ease. I am loving it.

  The sound quality is very average. The background sound will be more than voice or pronounciation. You have to keep increasing or decreasing the volume. If the video is in same rithym , let's say the person in the video is only talking , then it's smooth and constant , you can enjoy your video . But suddenly when background music comes , it overtakes the voice . You have to reduce it . But it is worth the price guys . Ours is a 32 inch and every quarters and house in our township is using it .

  It is my first experience of VU tv and i wanted to say that i donot know how is the picture quality and etc because there is no installation happened from 2nd Oct. I never thought buying a TV would be so painful. I repent I would have purchased Other renowned brands like Sony or Samsung for that matter. I donot when will the installation happen neither Amazon is able to help. Real bad experience. Complete disappointment.

  TV is exceptionally good. The picture clarity is excellent. I have one issue though, and that is if sound. The spoken voices in movies are very less audible and the background music is almost twice loud at same volume. If i want to hear the dialogues properly, then the music score blasts through the TV. Can someone help me with this ? Tried almost all settings. Will give 5 star if problem is solved.

  1. There is no external speaker connection jack with this TV. It was not told earlier.2. The built in speakers are giving cracking sound when low frequency sound comes out from speakers. Without connection to external speakers, it is impossible to use this TV.Anyway, it has again been proved that cheap products are always bad. I was cheated by VU TV Californea through Amazon India.

  Except the Processor every thing is wonderful in this. Processor is very slow. Taking too much time to on or Booting very slow.Thanks to VU, very supportive customer care....above mentioned issue got resolved after first update on TV. Now I can say that this one is a best buy. Amazing Picture quality, Good sound. All apps functioning/working very fine.Must buy option in this segment.

  Better read full review if u r buying this tv. Pros and Cons r below. So lets begin.This is My 2nd VU tv and I am enjoying it. This tv is best if u watch a lot of ott content (Netflix,Amazon,youtube etc) and tv channels. Hd setupbox is preferred to get good clearity. Sd channels are also good but it depends on transmission quality of that channel. Hassle free and fluid operation of tv as expected. This is a Tv and not a mobile phone or pc so playing games from playstore is not advisable, however if u have a PlayStation then this tv won't disappoint u.Pros:Good Picture QualityGood soundInstalls and Plays almost every app u throw at it (not talking about high graphic games like pubg, asphalt etc)wireless headphones, mouse, keyboard, gaming joystick support.Lots of settings to tweak your tv as per uer video and audio preferences.5star bee rating for electricity consumption.Dedicated keys on remote for apps preinstalled on tv.Everything works super fine once u update and reset uer tv.Cheaper than 4k tv.Many more!Cons:I say cons comparing it to my other VU tv which is 4k uhdPicture quality is less (obviously displays less pixels than a 4k)Can't play 4k videos online or through USB.(cos its not a 4k tv its a 2k tv), even if the video plays it won't be a 4k video.Video upscaling not good as a 4k tv.No voice assistant support on tv remote.(I hardly use it even on my 4k tv)1less hdmiportDoesn't have Features like HDR, Dolby in it.Viewing distance is more (minimum 6ft compared to my 4k which is 4ft)So that's it.. Other than above cons I don't think my 2k tv is not good as my 4k tv.This tv beats its fhd competitors one sided and is best value for money if u r buying a fhd. The settings and features found in this tv are so much customizable you can get best results in both video and audio.If uer budget is 25k+ just buy a 4k tv. The newer models of vu like premium android or the latest vu cinema will be best buys. But before buying a 4k tv just remember there is  not too much 4k content available currently. Also if 4k is 4 times clear it also is 4times bigger in file size means more data consumption and more internet speed required. All dth providers provide fhd channels or sd channels so buying 4k tv only to watch them is not worth.Hope my review helps u choose the best.
